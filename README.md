data visualization of USGS earthquake data


Background: The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about
natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use 
change. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their
earthquake data. In this challenge I'm tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow
them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

To complete this challenge I'll use a variety of tools:
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
leaflet

Within a JavaScript file I'll use D3.json to contact an API endpoint and retrieve earthquake data. Then,
I'll use several functions to:
-create features (visual markers) on a map;
-create popups containing summary information pertaining to each earthquake;
-create a map object;
-determine the colors to use to assist in quantifying the earthquakes

Thus far I've completed only Part I of the challenge. Time permitting, I'll attempt Part II.
